    <p>
      There are so many people who do not need to own a computer, colour
      printer, copier or laminator because they hardly ever need to use one, but
      when the need arises where do you go?
    </p>
    <p>
      Come to CJ Trading &amp; Signs where we are in a security boom controlled
      Estate with parking on the premises.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Type out your Documents that are emailed, on memory stick or even neatly

        Type your CV.
      </li>
      <li>Make photocopies in B/W or full colour.</li>
